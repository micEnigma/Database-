//Five queries that will work on the database pictured:

1.	SELECT: This selects data from a database and stores it in a results table. The results table's results varies depending on what is being queried and how it is being queried. For instance using the wildcard "*" pulls everything on the queried database to the results table.
// SELECT * FROM table_name -- Selects all data on table_name


2.	DELETE: This deletes specified rows from the specified database. When no row parameters are specified, the whole database table will be deleted.
// DELETE FROM table_name -- Deletes all data from table_name


3.	CREATE TABLE: This creates a new table in a database. The table consists of rows and columns and a table name must be specified.
// CREATE TABLE MatchTable	-- Creates MatchTable with the parameters listed
	(
	SportID int,
	Venue varchar(255),
	SportType varchar(255),
	City varchar(255)
	); 


4.	DROP TABLE: This also deletes a specified table.
//DROP TABLE table_name -- Deletes table_name


5.	UPDATE: is used to update existing records in a table.

6.	ORDER BY: This sorts the result-set according to parameters in one or more columns.
// SELECT * FROM MatchTable
   ORDER BY Date;
